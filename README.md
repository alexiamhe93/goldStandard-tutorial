# Tutorial for measuring psychological variables in text using a Gold-standard accuracy approach

This repository contains three tutorial Python notebooks. All three notebooks are based on a case study for measuring misunderstandings in online dialogues (at a sentence level). The notebooks concern:

1. [https://github.com/alexiamhe93/goldStandard-tutorial/blob/616a6436404ae7029db8649fba2aed861991eabb/Tutorial_1_Inter_rater_reliability.ipynb] Conducting inter-rater reliability on a subset of a "gold-standard" dataset, hand-coded by multiple coders for a psychological construct.  
2. Developing and validating a rule-based dictionary classifier using the gold-standard dataset.
3. Developing and validating a deep-learning classifier using the gold-standard dataset (fine-tuning a BERT model through transfer learning).
