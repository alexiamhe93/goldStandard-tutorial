# Tutorial for measuring psychological variables in text using a Gold-standard accuracy approach

This repository contains three tutorial Python notebooks. All three notebooks are based on a case study for measuring misunderstandings in online dialogues (at a sentence level). There are three tutorial notebooks:

1. [Tutorial 1](Tutorial_1_Inter_rater_reliability.ipynb): Conducting inter-rater reliability on a subset of a "gold-standard" dataset, hand-coded by multiple coders for a psychological construct.  
2. [Tutorial 2](Tutorial_2_Rule_based_dictionary_classifier.ipynb): Developing and validating a rule-based dictionary classifier using the gold-standard dataset.
3. [Tutorial 3](Tutorial_3_Deep_learning_BERT_classifier.ipynb): Developing and validating a deep-learning classifier using the gold-standard dataset (fine-tuning a BERT model through transfer learning).

The [data](data/) folder contains the datasets for the tutorial notebooks and the [dictionaries](data/dictionaries/) for the rule-based classifier. The notebook tutorials automatically link to these folders and it is therefore not necessary to download the data.
